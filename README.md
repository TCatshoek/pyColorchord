# pyColorchord
My attempt at implementing something like colorchord, but in python

Original by cnlohr [here](https://github.com/cnlohr/colorchord).

This implementation probably won't be anywhere near as performant as anything written in pure C (although it is not bad so far, thanks numpy devs), but hopefully it will be easier to read for people who want to know how it works / don't have much experience in C.

Note recognition needs a lot of work still, and there are no cool visualizations yet.

# pyColorchord
My attempt at implementing something like colorchord, but in python

Original by cnlohr [here](https://github.com/cnlohr/colorchord).

This implementation probably won't be anywhere near as performant as anything written in pure C (although it is not bad so far, thanks numpy devs), but hopefully it will be easier to read for people who want to know how it works.

It is currently not yet functional, but the "chromatic" DFT is working at least.
